# Market Risk Simulator 📈

This is a simple text-based simulation tool I built using Python.

I am currently learning Python (Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code), and I wanted to combine my coding practice with my interest in Finance. This project simulates a volatile market where you have to decide between "Aggressive" and "Defensive" strategies.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project
The goal is simple: You start with a capital (e.g., $10,000) and try to double it within 5 years. But be careful, the market changes every year (Bull, Bear, or Volatile)!

## 🛠️ What I Used (Day 6 Concepts)
I built this project to practice the concepts I learned in Day 6 of the bootcamp:
* **While Loops:** To keep the simulation running until the time is up or money runs out.
* **If/Elif/Else:** To create different market scenarios and outcomes.
* **Functions:** I used `def run_simulation():` to organize my code.
* **Random Module:** To generate random market events.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Download the `main.py` file.
3.  Run it in your terminal or editor (like PyCharm).
4.  Enter your starting money and see if you can reach the target!

## 📝 Note
This is my first portfolio project. I know "Safe Mode" isn't a technical finance term, but I used logic similar to **Hedging** to protect the capital during bad market conditions.
